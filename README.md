# eCommerce_Order_Handler

## Overview: 🗣️  
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to manage orders in a simple eCommerce system.
It allows users (e.g., store admins or support staff) to interact with the order system directly through the terminal — making it
ideal for low-resource environments.
